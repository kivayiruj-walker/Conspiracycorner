  <article>
    <p>This article provides a balanced look at several claims once dismissed as conspiracy theories that later had elements verified by reputable sources or declassified documents. The goal is to examine each entry with sources and an emphasis on critical thinking.</p>

    <h2>1. Government Surveillance Programs</h2>
    <p>Major revelations about large-scale surveillance programs came to light through declassified documents and investigative reporting. When evaluating claims about surveillance, look for primary documents, official statements, and reporting from multiple reputable organizations.</p>

    <h2>2. Medical and Scientific Cover-ups</h2>
    <p>There are historical examples where early research, conflicts of interest, or poor regulation led to suppressed findings. Reliable accounts will include peer-reviewed studies, FOIA releases, or court records.</p>

    <h2>3–10. (Short summaries)</h2>
    <p>The rest of the list summarizes other notable cases where doubts were later partially or wholly validated. Always check primary sources and be cautious of sensational claims without evidence.</p>

      <li>Check primary documents (declassified files, court records)</li>
      <li>Look for reporting from multiple reputable outlets</li>
