    <p>This page summarizes historical programs that were later declassified or acknowledged, and explains the importance of source verification and context.</p>

    <h2>MK-Ultra and Human Experimentation</h2>
    <p>One well-documented example is MK-Ultra, a Cold War-era CIA program that included unethical human experiments. The program was investigated, and documents were eventually declassified. When reading about such topics, consult government records, congressional reports, and academic analyses.</p>

    <h2>How to read declassified material</h2>
    <p>Declassified documents can be fragmentary. Seek corroborating sources and expert interpretation before drawing strong conclusions.</p>
