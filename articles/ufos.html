  <article>
    <p>This article reviews notable UFO/UAP reports and how to assess witness testimony and physical evidence. The goal is a clear-eyed approach rather than sensationalizing unverified claims.</p>

    <h2>Notable Cases</h2>
    <p>We summarize widely reported incidents, explain what is known from official sources, and where uncertainty remains.</p>

    <h2>Evaluating Sightings</h2>
    <p>Consider sensor data, multiple independent witnesses, and corroborating records. Misidentification, sensor artifacts, and hoaxes account for many sightings.</p>
